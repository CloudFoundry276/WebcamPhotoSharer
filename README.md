In this project, we use kivy, wikipedia and requests libraries.

We use kivy library, to code Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Using kivy Builder, we load GUI for project.

We get image link using wikipedia library.

We get input from user, what they want to search on internet and, we download image from internet and save into our project in specified location and display respective image to the user.

For example, if user search for ocean then image for ocean is downloaded from internet and save in specified location and display to the user.
